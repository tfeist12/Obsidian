### Week of 10/21/25

**To Do:**
- Make story for updating the kubectl dsp plugin.
- Review Jonathan's Ippodd state monitoring change


Create questions for meeting with Charan on Wednesday
- Does the current R3 timeline account for the QA layoffs teams recently saw

Does Charan know that you told us the team was about to be laid off
Should Britt be included in the K9 chat with Charan

-ACTIVE spec and controller restart together are a problem since we can't use an inactive fw version update to determine when to start reboot
