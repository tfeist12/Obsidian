SBC last week
Got review out for getting updated lir-svc configmap pointer on each operation
Oddly seeing zeus problems even though build and install seem to work fine

working on get status ctx deadline exceeded bug today.
will sync up with matt about how he reproed his context deadline exceeded bug as I have a funny feeling these two bugs are cut from the same cloth.
want to spend a little more time looking If lir=svc can safely be killed by pid using britts shutdown script.
