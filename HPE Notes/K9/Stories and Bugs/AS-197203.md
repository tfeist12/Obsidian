Switchd to report if firmware version has been uploaded to the inactive partition ([AS-189429](https://jira.storage.hpecorp.net/browse/AS-189429 "Provide FW version for the secondary partition in ListSwitches/\"show switch\""))
Currently using a fixed wait time after which we assume the upload is complete.

[AS-197203](https://jira.storage.hpecorp.net/browse/AS-197203)

### NVGrid Switch Fake Firmware Update Request:
**Team K9 need all three firmware update related APIs to function in switch fake mode for testing purposes.**
1. SetOffline
	- Switch status field should update based on the SetOffline request
	- This status change needs to be reported in ListSwitches output
2. Upload Firmware
	- Indicate when firmware has been uploaded to the inactive partition
	- This change needs to be reported in ListSwitches output.
3. Reboot
	- Reboot functions the same way in fake mode.
	- New firmware version needs to be reported in ListSwitches output after reboot completion.
**We also need to know if there a convention used for mapping a firmware version to it's image filename? This is something we are currently validating before allowing a firmware update to commence.**
