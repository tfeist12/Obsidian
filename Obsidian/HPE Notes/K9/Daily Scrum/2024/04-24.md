
Verified lir-svc add release download resumption works as expected

Spent some time with Matt and Steve at the end of the day brain storming ways we could eliminate lldpd
- Started looking into EDS queries and where they are getting the switch IP initially - came up with a few ideas that perhaps we could discuss in round 2

Need to read up on Britt's source based routing change

Continue work with Matt on the switchd initialization script changes

Perhaps pull in the lir-svc TOI
