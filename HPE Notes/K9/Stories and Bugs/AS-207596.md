Reconcile Loop:
1. Trigger firmware update using spec change
2. Spec will differ from status until firmware update is complete. 
3. Check conditions in the setFwVersion function within the reconcile package
4. Use conditionals to move between steps

Questions:
- How do we know each step is complete?

Notes: 
- Need to deal with the case where the condition isn't found
- Do we have to create new conditions within the status
- Reasons are the the different states associated with update
- Need to understand conditions types better
