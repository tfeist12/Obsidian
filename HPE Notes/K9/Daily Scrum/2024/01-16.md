Worked on two bug fixes last week. One from pl9, another from pl10a

Discussed changes for my fix to the sequentially added releases failure with Matt and came up with a good solution. Updated the review but I need to do a bit more testing this morning. Blocked by needing an approval from Matt

Checked in the the lir-svc scale down on startup fix this morning

Looking into Proxy setting failure that was brought up in the k9 slack today

May pull in another bug if I have time
