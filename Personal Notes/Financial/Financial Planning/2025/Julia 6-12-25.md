**Updates:**
- Been putting my resume out there more. Not ready to leave quite yet but seeking new employment opportunities
- Within the next year I will likely pull some from the the TOD investment account to purchase a car.

**Since last meeting:**
- I've updated my accounting spreadsheet for tracking
- Looks like my risk tolerance has decreased to 54 on your scale.

**Questions:**
- I started at $53,000.00 in Mar 2021. Based on S&P500 returns over the last four years, I could be at $83,654.59 without accounting for the additional contributions I've made.

- Currently sitting at $64,536.25 so I wanted to better understand your investment methodology. 
	- Appears we’re trying to beat the market but we are just doing worse than the standard S&P 500
	- Why is everything so actively managed 
- What else would you like to see from me for financial development?
- How much exposure do I have to the bond market
	- Bonds are good for stability 
	- Rough equation: age = % in bonds 
- Remind me how much your services cost?
