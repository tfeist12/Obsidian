- Able to create an nginx container that is running on top of hexos just need to do some plumbing to get it working properly
- Need to integrate with NB build
- Goal of removing configmap for lir-f and using environment variables in helm instead
- Add user nobody to the config
- Need to direct output to strerr at /var/log/nginx/error.log using the config

curl localhost:31322/9999.0.0.0-1061452/install-control.yaml
