With regard to K9 code coverage numbers:

SonarCube doesn't provide the full picture of code coverage as it only shows line coverage within full directories. This doesn't include the .meta.yml file filters provided by Irina's team. Teams should likely start reporting coverage provided by both SonarCube and Qlik dashboard as this will show coverage for directories, individual commits, and team members. This should give us a better representation of code coverage.

Here is the link to Qlik dashboard if you want to check it out:
