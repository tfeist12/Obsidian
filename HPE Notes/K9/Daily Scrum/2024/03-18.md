**Friday:**

I was working on the lir not found status story. I updated the lir-svc API to include both NOT_FOUND and CODE_SIGN_FAILURE. Rebuilt everything in lir with no troubles and I believe I found the location where a change needs to happen in swus; however, I was unable to get swus unit tests working after making changes and messing with them

Talked to Steve Strange a bit and planning a meeting this week to discuss both the status not found story as well as the code signing failure change. I plan to invite Britt but let me know if anyone else is interested.

Checked in my switch controller ready state update story this morning since the branch was open.


**Today:**

Finished rereading Matt's review this morning

Need to finish my initial pass on Daniel's review and Steve's but waiting for it to be building before I spend time on it.
