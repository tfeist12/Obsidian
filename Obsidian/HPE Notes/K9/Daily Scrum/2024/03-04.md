Friday I wrote up a confluence page with my findings from the context deadline exceeded bugs Matt and I were working on. Currently it is attached to my personal space so need to find a good space for that to be viewed.

I also started refamiliarizing myself with the switch controller code in preparation for working on the cluster info population story: [AS-177047](https://nimblejira.nimblestorage.com/browse/AS-177047). Have come up with a few solutions:

1. We could requeue the switch reconciliation if we cannot get clusterinfo initially. This will mean that the switch crd will not get populated until we have a valid cluster info set so it is probably not the ideal choice.
2. The other option is to just add a simple check, to determine if the cluster info fields are set, at the end of the switch reconcile function. If not then we requeue a reconciliation.

I wasn't able to find anything about changing the controller deployment order within a single operator but thatâ€™s fine as this is a simple solution.

Today I have a few more small additions I'd like to add to it

Also need to start on changes and once I get those out probably pull in another story from the switch or lir misc epics

lir-data scaling timeout bug assigned to us that seems to be a network issue. someone mentioned that it appears to be a dup of an issue which is in code review so I'm keeping an eye on that one.
