Congratulations Jordan and Keanu,

It was wonderful to experience your big day with you. I'm glad you ended up deciding to host on the farm. It made for a beautiful event that none of us will soon forget. I'm excited to see where your journey together takes you. Wishing you a lifetime of love, laughter, and adventure. I'm looking forward to seeing you both again very soon!

Love,
-Tyler
