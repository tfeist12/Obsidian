Last week I worked on my configurable lir-svc timeouts and retries change
- I should be able to check that in today
Working on AS-184041 which is a bug that Tejaswi filed about getting a connection refused error when making a grpc request to lir-svc
- I believe I have a theory about what happened on this one and a potential solution
Work on providing code reviews and perhaps verifying other stories to help QA get those resolved
