**Britt Mentorship:**
- Would you be willing to mentor me in a more serious capacity?
- I feel like I have learned a lot from you informally mentoring me since you started as the team's architect
- I am someone who enjoys continuously learning and I have been looking for ways to continue my development
- I'd like to understand what your day to day looks like at the architect level and gain a better understanding of the product at a higher level
- I think this could be as simple as an hour a week talking about the product more, what you're working on, as well as of course shooting the shit!
