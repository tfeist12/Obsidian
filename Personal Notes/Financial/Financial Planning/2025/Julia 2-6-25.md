**Tyler's Current Goals (How do I prioritize?)**
1. Want 3-6 months of income ($35k-$70k) saved. Currently at $17k in savings.
	- Need to Increase my emergency fund
2. Contribute more to Roth IRA since there is a maximum allowed income?
	- Currently have maxed HSA 
		- Need to stop using this money. Spend out of pocket instead
	- Going to max Roth IRA this year
	- Work towards max 401k 
3. Replace car in the next year without going into debt.
	- Julia thinks I could get a good rate and not worry much about having a loan
4. Slightly more long term but begin paying down my house faster.
	- Add one extra mortgage payment at the end of the year 

**Financial order of operations**
1. Match 401k company contribution first
2. Max HSA
3. Max your Roth IRA 
4. Max your 401k
