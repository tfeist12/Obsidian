- Does the current R3 timeline account for the QA layoffs teams recently saw?
- It was an abrupt change learning that our team was no longer part of upcoming layoffs.
	- How did you manage to convince upper management?
	- If the reason is the R3 timeline, how we remain confident that there will be a place for us after this release?
	- It has been made clear that HPE's goal is to approach a 70% India and 30% US employee split.
	- Curious if you can speak to this decision more. I understand it as a cost saving measure but are there any other driving factors
	- In our experience over the past few months, training new contractors has slowed our progress.


- How do we remain confident there will be work for K9 after R3 if we knew the team was about to be laid off
- Communication needs to improve
- Discuss contractors.
