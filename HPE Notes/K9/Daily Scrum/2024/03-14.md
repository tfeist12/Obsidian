**Yesterday:**
- Talked to Matt about the switch controller not showing not ready when it needs to story.
	- Accepted now and I wanted to push but branch locked
- Talked with Amit regarding updating an Ironfist removerelease test script
- Assigned myself the story to add a not found status to lir but i'm unsure if this is a priority
- Housekeeping work - converting notes to markdown 

**Today:**
- Get code reviews checked in 
- See if I have any outstanding reviews to give
- Work on whatever lir-misc story that is highest priority
- I'd like to chat with matt and the team about the suggestion to have the switch controller create it's resources instead of swus to get naming right
