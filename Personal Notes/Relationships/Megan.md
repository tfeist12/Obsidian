- I do have a lot of fun spending time with you but you feel like more of a friend than a girlfriend
- I don't feel physical intimacy when I'm with you. Our sexual connection has been poor considering the point in the relationship we're at
- For someone who claims to be independent, she is really quite needy and a little insecure
- I'm a very independent and busy person and I haven't been feeling like a seeing each other twice per week has been building our connection
- Still think we're at different points in our lives
- Not seeing a long term future between us
