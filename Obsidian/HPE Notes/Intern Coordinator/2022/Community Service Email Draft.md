We have a fantastic opportunity for Interns looking to get to know their peers as well as help out the greater Fort Collins community!

On July 26th we will be doing a community service event with the Gardens on Spring Creek.  The Gardens on Spring Creek is the community botanic garden with 12 acres of gardens and a tropical butterfly house! From 8AM to 12PM we will be helping out by mulching pathways and garden beds in the Foothills Garden. If we're lucky we may be able to see some butterflies too! 

Parking and Arrival: The Gardens is located at 2145 Centre Ave between Drake and Prospect in central Fort Collins. Please park your car (or bike) in the main parking lot. If you are unable to get there but want to participate, let us know and we may be able to coordinate rides.

Waivers: Please complete the attached waiver and send it to us. There will also be printed waivers that can be completed upon arrival for the volunteer project.

What to Wear/Bring:

- Water bottle (we have water refill stations onsite)
- Closed Toe Shoes
- Comfortable clothing you are willing to get dirty!
- Gardening gloves (if you don’t have them, they will have pairs onsite)
- Sunscreen (we also have some onsite)

There will be an HPE sponsored Lunch afterwards as well!

This event is always a blast so hope to see you all there!
