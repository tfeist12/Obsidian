2014 VW CC Executive 4Motion for sale.

This VW CC Executive 4motion is the top of is the 2014 VW sedan lineup. This car is a rare find, as it features a 3.6L VR6 engine with 280HP and all-wheel drive (AWD). It's been great for getting up into the mountains as well as taking long road trips.

Excellent condition for its age with minor cosmetic issues. This car has been garage-kept. I don't want to sell as this is a fantastic daily driver, but I've decided it is time. I picked up a motorcycle, and I'd like a truck to transport it as well as do some off-roading.

All service is up to date. I like to do the oil change early using LiquiMoly oil. I will include a copy of the carfax for review. 

Some features I appreciate about the vehicle:
- Keyless entry
- Heated and ventilated leather seats
- Auto-dimming mirrors
- Dual-zone climate control
- Large tilting sunroof
- High-end Dynaudio sound system
- Optical parking sensors
- Hands-free truck open
- Hidden reverse camera
- Upgraded VW rims
- Full-size spare tire

Includes:
- Two pairs of keys
- Michelin X-Ice Snow tires I purchased last year
- Both rubber and carpet floor mats
- Weather tech windshield reflector
- VW car-go organizers and first aid kit
- Thule rack mount points with wing bars. I also have a Thule bike rack (pictured), Thule ski rack, and rooftop box, which are all keyed the same. I would be willing to include these for an additional cost.

Serious buyers are welcome to test drive. This is my daily driver so the mileage will increase.
