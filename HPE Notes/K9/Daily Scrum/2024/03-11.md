Last Week:
- Assigned the operator log clean up story to nighthawk after creating a log characterization script which determined we're not the problem.
- Checked in switch controller retry reconcile if cluster info fields don't get set change.
- Posted review for the remove release garbage collector potentially not using the right lir-data primary fix.

Today:
- Look at Britt's code signing change
- Pulled in AS-180795 - When Switch Controller can't talk to switchd, the CR still looks healthy, should be in not-ready/error state
