Why has Devin only been paying $41 per month for Guardian Storage?

Did he pay some kind of admin fee at the start?

Current Rate = 96/2 = 48

Billing Records:
Aug 24: $106.56
Sept 24: $0
Oct 24: $54
Nov 24: $54
Dec 24: $54
Jan 25 Onwards: $96
.....
Jun 25 Onwards: $107

106.56+54\*3+96\*5 = $748.56 Total charges up until June 
748.56/2 = $374.28 = Per person charges charges until June

Started paying rent/storage in September so
41 * 9 = $369

374.28 - 369 = $5.28 difference

Just split the 107 going forward
New Rate = 107/2 = 53.5
