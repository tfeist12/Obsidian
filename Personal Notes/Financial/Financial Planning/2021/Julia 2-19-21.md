- If we are using my Canadian Inheritance from my GIC account. Do I have to convert first or will you do that for me? If so at what rate?
- If I wanted to contribute every month would you recommend putting it into the TOD account since its more liquid? Future Goal of buying a house is important.
- Could we setup a system where you take X amount out of checking each month?
- Is the Roth IRA we are setting up separate to my current one or is it possible to do them together? If so, can you access my current ROTH IRA?
- If I have companies that I am interested in investing in can I run them by you to investigate first?
