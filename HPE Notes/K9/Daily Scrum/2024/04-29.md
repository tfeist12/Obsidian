All my stories are verified so I'm just finding work where I can

Friday:
- Looking at 184377 - Matt and I determined this is an invalid bug as they were testing for a case not allowed by switchd
- Wrote a quick story for updating the logging of the switch controller as storage node controller folks recommended a switch to a common package across the board

Today:
- Actually get started on the lir-svc TOI now that I have the resources I need
- Looking into a request of Britt's -> Recovery mode in which we add a release if we have a broken control plane node
	- Disable scaling -> This only prevents scaling right?
	- add anti-affinity to prevent a broken node from being used -> is there anything preventing lir-data currently from starting on a broken node
- Any pressing external issues Ron may have found
