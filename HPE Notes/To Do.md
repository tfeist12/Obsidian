**To Do:**

- Start working on 2026 goals


### 2026 Goals: 
Create a minimum of three Bold Goals using any of these four FY26 categories (select only one category per goal): **Business Results**, **Innovation**, **Transformation**, or **Leadership** (You don't need to use every category, if not applicable).

- **Business Results:** Goals related to execution and operational excellence that impact business performance, including key financial and customer success metrics.​
- **Innovation:** Goals related to improving efficiency, solving challenges or meeting emerging needs through product/services, programs/projects, automation/AI and more.​
- **Transformation:** Goals related to rethinking and reinventing the way things are done—unlocking new possibilities for growth, impact, or progress.​
- **Leadership:** Goals related to leadership culture by modelling HPE Beliefs & Behaviors and Elements of Leadership.​

**Ron Suggestions:

**Britt Suggestions:
- Get more involved in DI design - K9 doesn't need to make many changes to our current areas
	- This will likely require more work with other teams
- Understand NFS configuration and setup on HomeFleet - K9 needs a more direct connection to file related work
