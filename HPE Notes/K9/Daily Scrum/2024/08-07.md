- Cloned and checked out Britt's hf dev tools scripts to get latest versions. Created a PR for some of my personal changes to them
- Continued with editing my lir-data corruption service design page. Broke down into a list of stories on the design page without creating them
- This morning I have been reading the two bugs Ron posted about yesterday
- Final intern event for the summer today so I will be out most of the afternoon. Should be available on slack if anyone needs me
