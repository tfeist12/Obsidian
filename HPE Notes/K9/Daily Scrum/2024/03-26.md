Four retry sections in lir-svc
- Download and verify
- Container Push
- File Push
- Replication

think bigger picture on retry… what about the case where a lir-data secondary pod is recreated while we’re pushing to primary and now the IP’s we have are stale… if we’re adding retry in the rsync phase, we might want to cover that scenario too… i guess we could call `GetLIRDataAddresses()`  again through the loop checking for changes… making sure our originally selected primary is still in the list, then the other 2 IPs can be used for syncing again

if the primary isn’t in the list of IPs anymore, then how do you know which pod has the data (this would be a weird case where primary crashes right after we finish pushing containers to it… in that case i’d bail out to swus
