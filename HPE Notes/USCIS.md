- Much difficulty crossing the border this time around
	- USCIS and USCBP are two separate orgs so USCBP could only see the case had been pending for over three years when I crossed
	- Of course got grilled asking how I screwed this up and why it had been pending for so long.
	- They softened up a lot after I explained the situation and they realized it was not my fault; however, I was still told I need to sort this situation out
	- Otherwise next time I cross I will either not be allowed back in or I will be heavily fined
	- when I asked what I should do they actually told me to go camp out at he USCIS office
	- unbelievable as these offices don't even let you in if you don't have an appointment
- Currently in the process of getting a passport stamp that should allow for summer travel but this is a temporary solution
- I think we should go ahead with working with Fragoman to get this taken care of
- I want to speak to someone who can help either on the phone or in person
- I believe the legal costs should be split between HPE and If they want me to remain here in the future
- Outside of normal processing time no responses
- Attempted to call multiple times to get updates
- ADIT stamp requests are failing
- Ombudsman is the next step
- Truly am at my wits end here
