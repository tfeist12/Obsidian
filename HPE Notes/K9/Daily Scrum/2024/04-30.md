- Proxy change restarting lir-svc multiple times bug 
- Write story for lir-svc recovery mode
	- Disable scaling of lir-data replicas
	- Add anti-affinity to ensure prevention of a broken node from being used
	- Readiness check lir-data to prevent serving data before all replicas are in sync -> not completely necessary as image pull backoff will cause (kubelet to?) retry internally
	- Since we can't add grpcurl to the node, we should add a grpc client program to trigger a rsync
