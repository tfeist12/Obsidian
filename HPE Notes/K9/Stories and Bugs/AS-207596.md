APIs:
- SetOfflineRequest
- UploadFirmwareRequest
- RebootSwitchRequest

Reconcile Loop:
1. Trigger firmware update using spec change
2. Spec will differ from status until firmware update is complete. 
3. Check conditions in the setFwVersion function within the reconcile package
4. Use conditionals to move between steps

Questions:
- How do we know each step is complete?

Notes: 
- Need to deal with the case where the condition isn't found
- Need to understand conditions types better

Code:

// This occurs during the next reconcile refresh operation.
