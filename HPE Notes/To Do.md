### Week of 10/21/25

**To Do:**
- Make story for updating the kubectl dsp plugin.
- Review Jonathan's IP-Podd state monitoring change

Create questions for meeting with Charan on Wednesday
- Does the current R3 timeline account for the QA layoffs teams recently saw
- How do we remain confident there will be work for K9 after R3 if we knew the team was about to be laid off

-ACTIVE spec and controller restart together are a problem since we can't use an inactive fw version update to determine when to start reboot
