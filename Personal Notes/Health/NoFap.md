Why is this my goal:

Effects of excessive masturbation and usage of pornography:

- Many dopamine spikes over a prolonged period is likely poor for brain development
- Risk of ED
- Emotional control
- Improved self-esteem and confidence
- Greater sex drive
- More driven and focused
- Better mental clarity
- Improved sleep
- Social improvement on retention
- Instant gratification makes you lazy, weak and depressed
- If you want access to interesting women, cut PMO out of your life

Masturbation is not the issue itâ€™s pornography
Prevent access to pornography
Change source of stimulation
