First Layer:
- Make the daisy: Yellow center with white petals
	- Use the yellow daisy to create the white cross with correct colour placement
- Find remaining white stickered pieces
    - If white is an edge piece then use other side color and it's direction (found by matching color to the center) to move to base with the associated trigger.
    - If white is a top piece then position it above where it needs to move on the base and perform two of the same trigger. Next follow the above step.
    - If white is a edge piece that is on the base then perform a trigger based on the side of the cube it resides. Next follow the above steps.

Second Layer:
- Find central edge pieces with no yellow and create an upside-down T.
- Pull side with matching center then do associated trigger
- Fix displaced white stickered pieces

Third Layer:
- Make the yellow cross – no correlation, sticker line pointing away, or backwards L to start
    - F U R U' R' F'
- Solve yellow face – yellow sticker bottom left outwards or arrow SW
    - R U R' U R U2 R'
- Position corners – sandwiched colour or solved face left
    - L' U R U' L U R' R U R' U R U2 R'
- Rotate edges – if there is a solved face then face it away from you
    - Clockwise rotation:
	    - F2 U R' L F2 L' R U F2
	- Counter Clockwise Rotation:
	    - F2 U' R' L F2 L' R U' F2
- Rotate edges - if none of the edges are solved
	- perform CCW x2
