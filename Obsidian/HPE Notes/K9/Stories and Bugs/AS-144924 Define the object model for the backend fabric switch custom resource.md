To Do:
Get in touch with Maria about switch configuration

Ongoing Questions:
- Where do we get the initial config if we want to call update config. Do we store and make changes
- Do switchloginfo and switchstats count toward readable elements as they are a part of the collect telemetry response?
- How was it decided which switch settings have getters and setters (Shantanu?)

Story Notes:
- Determine default values for the spec keys
- Unsure if I need to include requests and response in the yaml
	- these functions will be implemented in the protobuf and in the switchd client
- Should we update mock switchd as well as the operator controller/client?Â 
- GRPC calls made to switchd based on what the spec and status show needs to be done
- Check what the architecture currently is and use that to determine readable attributes
- Repeated in the proto file means that that field can be repeated any number of times including zero

Top Down Architecture:
1. GLCP: Greenlake Cloud platform
2. Switchdoperator <-> Local image repository
3. Switchd
	1. mcall, grpc, rest
	- grpc is external request to switchd?
	2. mcall is internal request for information?
	- rest to the switch itself?
4. Aruba switch

Teams:
- nvgrid = containerization of switchd
- switch_mgmt = switchd proper
