Example: lir-svc remove release triggers a garbage collect on lir-data

This is exactly the same as what we want to do to get the firmware image file to switchd

The command will make the switchd pod curl the file from lir-data file server

Refactor DSP for reuse in Ip-Pod-V2

Problem:
Many of the packages used by the DSP pod could be reused by the ip-pod-v2 in the future. 

Implementation:
Moved the config, etcdclient, k8s client, and to a common location 'hfcluster/src/common/activation-pod'
Fixed existing unit tests

Test Plan:
- Verified successful build and install
- Ran unit tests
- Ran TaaS Ring1: https://zeus.itools.nimblestorage.com/react-app/dashboard/private/prj-fleetos-next/latest/pvt/0.0.9100.0-1757023273534220-opt/4534443/ring1
