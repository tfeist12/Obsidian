Daniel's code review. Need to look at it again today after the recent changes

Following along on the bugs with /proc fs issues on hfsim 

I want to spend the next day or two determining a project to focus on in the upcoming sprint. I may begin work on the lir-data corruption repair service 

If anyone needs help let me know, I'm available
