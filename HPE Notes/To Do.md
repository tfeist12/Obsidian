**To Do:**
- Make story for updating the kubectl dsp plugin.
- Make story to refactor lir-svc configmap code to use k8scommon configmap functions
- Send all open buffers to copilot
- Use Claude as model for copilot chat
- Start working on 2026 goals


### 2026 Goals: 
**Britt Suggestions:
- Get more involved in DI design - K9 doesn't need to make many changes to our current areas
	- This will likely require more work with other teams
- Understand NFS configuration and setup on HomeFleet - K9 needs a more direct connection to file related work

Complete HomeFleet R3 release in mid January 
Contribute to HomeFleet R4 and R5 releases
