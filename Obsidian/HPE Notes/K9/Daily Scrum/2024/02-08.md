checked in both my reviews
- get status bug
- lir-svc permission reduction

looked into querying ncs from within a pod to help steve. after reading his story I released we didn’t have to use grpc to talk to npd

Started looking into the lir-svc configmap bug but didn’t get too far, pretty stumped so maybe need to discuss in round 2
