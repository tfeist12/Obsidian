- Does the current R3 timeline account for the QA layoffs teams recently saw?
	- We lost the closest person we had to a networking expert and someone primarily focused on test automation creation so this will slow our progress
- It has been made clear that HPE's goal is to approach a 70% India and 30% US employee split whereas cluster services is the opposite split.
	- Curious if you can speak to this decision more. I understand it as a cost saving measure but are there any other driving factors
	- In our experience over the past few months, training new contractors has slowed our progress.
	- The time difference is challenging when we have to closely monitor their work
- It was an abrupt change learning that our team was no longer part of upcoming layoffs.
	- How did you manage to convince upper management to keep K9?
	- If the reason is the R3 timeline, how we remain confident that there will be a place for us after this release is completed?
- Communication Improvements
	- First time I've ever had direct communication with you. Perhaps doing a meeting like this more often would be useful

**General Notes:**
- Data Intelligence
- Need examples
