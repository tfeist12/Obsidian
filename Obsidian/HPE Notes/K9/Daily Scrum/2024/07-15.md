Friday:
- Fort Collins intern volunteer day
- Retro - new jira board could be nice to incorporate into our agile workflow
- Talked to Britt a little bit about the download error handler
- Spent a little more time on the TOI

Today:
- Look at our bug backlog and potentially pull something in
- appears that 1.7.18 containerd has been tested now so I need to see if there is anything else I can do on the containerd bug at this point
- Schedule a meeting for the lir-svc TOI review likely for tomorrow
- Kaizen tips
