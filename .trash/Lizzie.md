Hey I want to come clean and let you know that I’ve had fun getting to know you over these last few weeks but i’m not seeing this going anywhere. Living in different locations makes creating plans more difficult than I expected. I also feel like we’re just at different spots in our lives and we don’t have as much of a connection as I was hoping for. I’m really sorry. You’re very cool though and I do hope you end up finding what you’re searching for!
