**Week of 7/21/25**

To Do:
- Update nvim config and push to repo
- Check on goals
- Make story for updating the kubectl dsp plugin.

Today:
- Intern poster feedback
- Start working on the switch conditions story we made last week

dsp name is the name of the deployment
pod name is the per instance name of the pod 

consts within the etcd client become part of config
perhaps pod type is part of config
when you create a config at the highest level you provide the type
We can actually use the existing act

Need to update comments that mention dsp and osd
