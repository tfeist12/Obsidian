- First off, I very clearly need to understand sports betting better
- I want to gamify sports betting ==better==
- Would you rather but for sports betting
- Sports bet over under at a frequency
- Easy, medium, hard and live leagues
- Harder is faster. Less time to think
- Frequency depends on both the sport and the league
- Either use AI or experts to generate questions. 
- Joel - When you have the over under nobody wants to see the under
- Joel - If you bet, usually you watch. Usually you want the over. Could tie this in with advertising somehow
- 90% bet with their heart, not their head. Capitalize on that
- Look into amount of people who sports bet. Over vs under. Need tons of stats to make this work in your favour
- Need dad to share his excel skills to start this. Make bets on a ton of different input stats
- Each player is ranked on a bunch of different stats. Much like an NHL <n> game. Could change every season.
- Socially I hate this, but economically I think this would work
